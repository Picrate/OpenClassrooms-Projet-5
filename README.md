# üß¨ Installing and running

## Running locally for development

To install locally, you must first clone the repository.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Picrate/OpenClassrooms-Projet-5.git
```
## Install MySQL server

If MySQL server is not installed in your computer follow these installation instructions:

- [Download & Install](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
- [MySQL Reference Manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/)

### Create Database, MySQL user & configure Grant Access for user
First we connect to MySQL Server as **root**;
- From shell
```shell
mysql -p
Enter password : 
```
- Then create an empty database (choose your own)
```SQL
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS '<dbname>';
```
- Create a database user with password (choose you own)
```SQL
CREATE USER '<dbuser>'@'*' IDENTIFIED BY '<should_be_changed>';
```
- Grant all privileges to <dbuser> on database <dbname>
```SQL
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <dbname>.* TO '<dbuser>'@'%';
```
- Exit MySQL
```SQL
exit;
```
#### Execute schema.sql
You will find in the root of the repository a directory named `ressources/sql` at the root of the project. It contains the database schema creation script: `Schema.sql`.
For creating database schema and insert some datas, use the following command in a terminal:

```shell
mysql -u <dbuser> -p <dbname> < Schema.sql
```
Your database is ready.

## Backend
Backend application can be found in "back" subdirectory.
### Modify your backend application.properties
- Modify src/main/resources/application.properties to suite your database name and dbUsername & password
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/<dbname>?allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true
spring.datasource.username=<dbuser>
spring.datasource.password=<dbpassword>
...
```

### Create .jar package
```bash
mvn clean install
```
This will clean the project, download and install required dependencies, run tests and compile project into .jar file.

***If you don't want to include and execute tests in release***
```bash
mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```
### Running application
Compiled application can be found in target directory
To run this application, copy the 'yoga-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' to a clean directory then run:
```bash
java -jar yoga-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
This will run springboot executable and the backend API server will be accessible to 'http://localhost:8080'

**N.B.** Be sure to have MySQL server instance up and running before launching application.

## Testing
If you only want to run unit tests and integration tests, simply run:

```bash
mvn clean test
```
This will run all the tests and generate coverage report.

The coverage report is available at: 'back/target/site/jacoco/index.html'
